<!-- Approach: The approach is to use the date object to get time on every second
and then re-rendering time on the browser using the new time that we got by 
calling the same function each second.Clocks can be used in sites where time is the 
main concern like some booking sites or some app showing arriving times of train, 
buses, flights, etc.  -->
